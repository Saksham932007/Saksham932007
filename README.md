## About
I am a systems and AI research–focused undergraduate engineer with hands-on experience building low-level software systems and AI architectures from first principles.

My work spans operating system kernels, TCP/IP internals, and distributed infrastructure, alongside AI research including Transformer architectures from scratch, multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. In parallel, I actively conduct independent research and technical writing on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), agentic AI, and scalable AI systems.

I currently work in an international startup environment, contributing to backend infrastructure and AI systems with a focus on reliability, performance, and research-driven design.

I am seeking **on-site Systems / Infrastructure or AI Research internship opportunities in South Korea** starting **January 2026**.
